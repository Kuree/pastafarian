\section{Graph Definition for the Circuit}\label{sec:1}
Let the entire circuit design to be represented as a graph, $G(V, E)$. We define $V$
as terminals of a net, and $E$ as relations between two nets terminals.
For instance, in Listing~\ref{lst:1}, we have three variables, \texttt{a}, \texttt{b},
and \texttt{c}, hence we have three \textit{named} vertices: they are named because
they have direct correspondence to Verilog variables. Similar to synthesis, we create
a new vertex for every u-/bi-nary operators. These new vertices are not named
since they are created through expressions. For instance, \texttt{b + c} is represented
as a new vertex connected to both \texttt{b} and \texttt{c}.
For assignment, we introduce additional vertices as
``pass-through'' vertex, i.e. additional vertex that connects two vertices. For instance,
in Listing~\ref{lst:1}, the assignment vertex connects \texttt{a} and the new vertex
created by \texttt{b + c}, as showing in Figure~\ref{fig:1}.
\begin{lstlisting}[style={verilog-style}, caption={Graph example from Verilog},
    label={lst:1}]
logic [15:0] a;
logic [15:0] b;
logic [15:0] c;

assign a = b + c;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \input{figure1.tex}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Graph representation for Listing~\ref{lst:1}.}
    \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

To describe the behavior of conditional logic, e.g. \texttt{case} and \texttt{if}, and
clocking block, such as \texttt{always\_ff}. We introduce a new type of vertex, i.e.,
the \textit{control} vertex, and new type of edge for non-blocking assignment, as
shown in Listing~\ref{lst:2} and Figure~\ref{fig:2}. Notice that by introducing
control vertex and edge, we allow ``influence'' from one vertex to another vertex
even though there is no direct assignment. Mathematically speaking, that means
there is a path from the vertex used for conditional logic to the assigned vertex; in
this case, a path from \texttt{c} to \texttt{a}. We claim without proof that the graph
constructed by this method is a directed simple graph, which implies that any loop
in the graph has to go through at least two vertices.

We define the \texttt{source} of vertex is the function $source(v)$:
\[
    source(v) = \{x \mid x \in \mathcal{V} \cup {v}\quad\text{for all}\quad x \in \mathcal{E}(v) \} \cup \bigcup_{x \not \in \mathcal{V} \cup {v}}
                source(x)
\]
where $\mathcal{V}$ denotes the set of vertices that does not have any incoming edges,
i.e., constants and top-level IO ports, and $\mathcal{E}(v)$ is defined as the complete
set of $(x, v)$ such that $(x, v) \in E$ and $(x, v)$ is not a control edge.
Notice that this is a recursive definition to search the ``ultimate'' source of the
vertex, including itself.

logic [15:0] c;

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (b == c) begin
      a <= c;
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Finite State Machine (FSM)}\label{sec:fsm}
For the purpose of HDL-based design, we categorize FSM into two catagories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Explicit} FSM. This includes finite state machines where each state
    is defined explicitly with an integer, such as local parameters or enums.
    \item \textbf{Implicit} FSM. This includes counter-based state machines where
    states are defined in a finite range of values and the state value can decrement
    or increment at any cycle.
\end{itemize}
Although mathematically these two types of FSMs are equivalent: one can always be
converted to another, logic designers may prefer one over another depends on the
problem and coding styles. As a result, when we extract FSM we should consider both
types of FSMs.
\subsection{FSM properties and Its Graph Equivalence}
We claim that there are three properties that holds for any FSM, either implicit
or explicit:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The FSM state variable has to be a register.
    \item\label{item:1} All the sources to that FSM variable have to be either constant, ot itself,
    or combination of both with binary operators such as addition.
    \item The current value of the FSM state should be used to determined the next
    state.
\end{enumerate}

One caveat of last property is that it excludes the cases where a state machine
advances its state at every cycle regardless of inputs and state. This only happens
when the FSM is used as a counter and the maximum value of the counter is the maximum
value specified by its bit width. This, however, is trivial to detect, as shown
later.

Given the graph construction described in Section~\ref{sec:1}, we can show that the
equivalent following graph properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given vertex $v$, for all its connected vertices $w \in V$ such that
    $(w, v) \in E$, $E(w, v)$ is non-blocking and $V(w)$ is assignment.
    \item Given vertex $v$, each element in $source(v)$ has be to either a constant,
    or itself ($v$).
    \item Given vertex $v$, for all simple path $P$ from $v$ to $v$,
    $P = (v_0, v_1, \dots, v_i)$ such that $v_0 = v_i = v$ and $(v_{j-1}, v_{j}) \in E$,
    there exist an edge $e = (v_{j-1}, v_j)$ such that e is a control edge.
\end{enumerate}

It is trivial to show the first properties are equivalent since we create an assignment
vertex for each blocking and non-blocking assignment, then connect that assignment vertex
to the sink vertex.

To show that the second properties are equivalent, notice that the $source$ function
is recursive and the base case is the set $\mathcal{V} \cup v$ for a given vertex
$v$. Furthermore, Since $V$ is the set of all constants and IO ports, if $sources(v)$ are itself
or constant, it means that $v$ is not a data-path register.

To show the equivalence of the last properties, notice the introduction of \textit{control}
edge, which indicates the presence of a conditional logic. If a variable's current value
is used to determined the next value, there must be some conditional logic to use the
current value to mux out the next value, hence creating a control edge from that vertex.

For the corner case where the counter advances without comparing with the current
value, all its loop path will not have any control edge. However, the path length
must be 4: self $\rightarrow$ increment/decrement vertex $\rightarrow$ assignment vertex
$\rightarrow$ self.

\subsection{Relaxed FSM Properties}
In some cases where data path are mixed with control path, property~\ref{item:1} may not
hold anymore based on the coding style, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:3} and Listing~\ref{lst:4}. Although these
two code are logically equivalent, property~\ref{item:1} will fail on Listing~\ref{lst:4}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style={verilog-style}, caption={Conditional increment counter
    with constant source},
    label={lst:3}]
input logic clk;
input logic [15:0] a;
input logic [15:0] b;
logic [15:0] c;

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == b) begin
      c <= c + 1;
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style={verilog-style}, caption={Conditional increment counter
    with constant source},
    label={lst:4}]
input logic clk;
input logic [15:0] a;
input logic [15:0] b;
logic [15:0] c;

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    c <= c + 16'(a == b);
end
\end{lstlisting}

To accommodate this use case, we can relax property~\ref{item:1} with some heuristics:
when the binary operator is addition or subtraction, one of the operand is itself and the
other operand is a single-bit value (before the bit-width conversion), we treat that
single-bit value as constant source.

\subsection{Implicit FSM Detection}
Based on the definition in Section~\ref{sec:fsm}, the only difference between implicit and
explicit FSM is that implicit has a source that combines itself with another constant with
a binary operation. We can use that property to distinguish these two FSMs. To put that
in the graphical terms, given a FSM vertex $v$, there exists a path,
$(v_0, v_1, \dots, v_i, v)$, where all the edges are not control edge and
$v \in \{v_0, v_1, \dots, v_i\}$.

\subsection{Coupled FSM Interaction}
When the value of one FSM machine affects another FSM, we call these two FSMs \textit{coupled}
and there are some logic that interacts with these two. For instance, in a controller logic,
the valid output FSM can only be in valid state if the main FSM is in transaction state.
Finding out these interactions between coupled FSM is very straight-forward given our graph setup.
Given two FSM vertices, $v$ and $w$, if there is a simple path from $v$ to $w$ that contains
a control edge, then $v$ and $w$ are coupled.


\section{Algorithms and Implementation Details}
This section describes algorithms used to extract FSM, the type of each FSM, and their interaction.
It also highlights some implementation details to speed up the computation.

\subsection{FSM Extraction}

The overall algorithm to extract FSMs from a given Verilog file is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:1}.

\begin{algorithm}[!tbh]
    \label{alg:1}
    \KwIn{Verilog file $V$}
    \KwResult{List of FSM variables and their states}
    $G \gets$ parse\_verilog($V$)\;
    $Regs \gets$ identify\_registers(G)\;
    $result \gets$ $\{\}$\;
    \For{$r \gets$ Regs}{
        $\text{const\_sources} \gets$ get\_const\_sources($r$)\;
        \If{$|\text{const\_sources}| > 0$ and $\text{has\_control\_loop}(r)$}{
            $result \gets result \cup \{(r, \text{const\_sources}\}$\;
        }
    }
    \Return{result}\;
 \caption{Overall algorithm to extract FSMs}
\end{algorithm}

In \textit{parse\_verilog}, to report all the hierarchical name (handle name) for the FSM variable,
we add a new type of vertex to represent Verilog module and for each vertex store a
\texttt{parent} to point back to its hierarchical parent.

The algorithm for \texttt{identify\_registers} is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:2}, which examines
the incoming edges for each named vertex in the graph $G$.
\begin{algorithm}[!tbh]
    \label{alg:2}
    \KwIn{Graph $G$}
    \KwResult{Set of register vertices}
    $Regs \gets$ \{\}\;
    \For{$v \gets$ VertexNamed(G)} {
        $is\_reg \gets true$\;
        \For{$e \gets InComingEdges(v)$} {
            \If{$e.type \neq BlockingAssignment$} {
                $is\_reg \gets false$\;
                \Break\;
            }
        }
        $Regs \gets Regs \cup \{v\}$\;
    }
    \Return{Regs}\;
 \caption{Algorithm for \texttt{identify\_registers}}
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm for \texttt{get\_const\_sources} is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:3}. We check the
connected vertices and if it is an external port, i.e. IO, we early out the recursion. Notice
that to avoid infinite loop and efficient search, in the actual implementation we need to
combine the algorithm with standard BFS with vertex coloring for visited/unvisited.
\begin{algorithm}[!tbh]
    \label{alg:3}
    \KwIn{Vertex $w$}
    \KwResult{A set of constant sources}
    $result \gets \{\}$\;
    \For{$v \gets ConnectedFrom(w)$} {
        \eIf{$v.type == Constant$} {
            $result \gets result \cup \{v\}$\;
        } {
            \If{$v.type == ExternalPort$} {
                \Return $\{\}$\;
            }
            $r \gets \text{get\_const\_sources}(v)$\;
            \If{$|r| == 0$} {
                \Return $\{\}$\;
            }
            $result \gets result \cup r$;
        }
    }
    \Return{result}\;
 \caption{Algorithm for \texttt{get\_const\_sources}}
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm for \texttt{has\_control\_loop()} is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:4}. Notice that
finding all the paths between two arbitrary vertices is hard and memory inefficient. Since the
goal is just to find one path that contains a control vertex, we can significantly speed up
the search process by borrowing the idea from union-find, as shown between Line~\ref{line:1} and
Line~\ref{line:2}. We maintain a set that contains all the vertex connected by or \textit{indirectly}
connected by a control edge. This is done through two passes: the first pass collect all the
vertices directly connected by a control edge, and the second pass colors any vertex connected by
vertices in the control set. During the second pass, if a new vertex is colored and it has been
visited, we remove it from the visited set so that we can recompute any path from that vertex.
The coloring process ended when there is no vertex let to color or the target vertex has been
colored and we have reached a loop. The correctness of the algorithm can be proved by induction
on the graph, where the base case is the smallest loop with control loop and we add a vertex to
the loop during induction step. For completeness we show the BFS version of the algorithm.
\begin{algorithm}
    \label{alg:4}
    \KwIn{Vertex $r$}
    \KwResult{$true$ if it contains a control vertex connected to $r$}
    $control\_set \gets \{\}$\;
    $visited \gets \{\}$\;
    $working\_set \gets queue\{r\}$\;
    // first pass to get the control set\;
    \While{$|working\_set| > 0$} {
        $v \gets working\_set.pop()$\;
        \eIf{$v \in visited$} {
            \Continue\;
        } {
            $visited \gets visited \cup \{v\}$\;
        }
        \For{$e \in Edges(v)$} {
            $w \gets e.end()$\;
            \If{$e.type == Control$} {
                $control\_set \gets control\_set \cup \{w\}$\;
            }
            $working\_set \gets working\_set \cup \{w\}$\;
        }
    }

    // second pass compute the result\;
    $working\_set \gets = queue{r}$\;
    $visited \gets \{\}$\;
    \While{$|working\_set| > 0$} {
        $v \gets working\_set.pop()$\;
        \If{$v == r$ and $v \in control\_set$} {
            \Return $true$;
        }
        \eIf{$v \in visited$} {
            \Continue\;
        } {
            $visited \gets visited \cup \{v\}$\;
        }
        \For{$w \in EdgesVertex(v)$} {
            \label{line:1}\If{$v \in control\_set$ and $w \in control\_set$} {
                $control\_set \gets control\_set \cup \{w\}$\;
                \If{$w \in visited$} {
                    $visited \gets visited \setminus \{w\}$\;
                }
            \label{line:2}}
            $working\_set.add(w)$\;
        }
    }
    \Return{false}\;
 \caption{Algorithm for \texttt{has\_control\_loop()}}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Counter Identification}
The algorithm to detect counter is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:5}. We are looking for a pattern of
$v \gets v + constant$ for a given $v$. However, since values may get passed through multiple
vertices, we need to recursively check all the assignment patterns. Notice that for performance,
we can rewrite the algorithm using a while loop instead of a recursive call.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
    \label{alg:5}
    \KwIn{Vertex $w$}
    \KwResult{$true$ if vertex is a counter}
    \For{$e \gets EdgesTo(w)$} {
        $v \gets e.start()$\;
        \If{$v.type == Assignment$ and $(x, w) \in E(G)$ and $x.type == Addition$} {
            \If{both a constant and $w$ connected to $x$} {
                \Return{true}\;
            }
        }
        $r \gets \text{detect\_counter(v)}$\;
        \If{$r$} {
            \Return{true};
        }
    }
    \Return{false}\;
 \caption{Algorithm for \texttt{is\_counter}}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Coupled FSM}
For given two FSM vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$, We can modify Algorithm~\ref{alg:4} where the
terminal condition is $v == v_2$ instead of $v == r$ and the algorithm will work out just
fine. Conceptually, if $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the same we will get a loop, which is what the
algorithm is designed for.

\subsection{Performance Optimization with Parallelism}
Notice that all the algorithms used in Algorithm~\ref{alg:1} are intentionally designed to not
share data during the iteration, nor do they modify the graph structure. As a result, we have
a list of embarrassingly parallel tasks each can be computed independently on each CPU core.
Given the nature of graph size as the design complexity grows, we can implement a thread-pool
and dispatch the tasks to available CPU cores.

\subsection{Parsing Verilog/SystemVerilog Files and Producing Graph}
There is an open-source SystemVerilog parser project called
slang~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang}}, and we have been contributing
to it by adding serialization ability on the symbol level (one compilation stage after syntax
tree parsing). The serialization dumps a JSON file and we can parse that efficiently using
simdjson~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson}}.

When generating the graph, since we are not interested in the exact logic other than label
the vertex as binary operation, unary operation, etc, we lose lots of logical information
that could be useful for other tasks. However, at this stage the extra information are
unnecessary and waste of memory and shall not be kept inside the data structure.
