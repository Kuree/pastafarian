Pastafarian: Automatic FSM Verification
=======================================
Pastafarian is a research project to automatically extract and verify FSM written in SystemVerilog, especially
generated by hardware generator frameworks such as Chisel and PyMTL. It does not require the RTL to be generated in
any particular style (or written, if you are working with hand-written RTL), as long as they are synthesizable
SystemVerilog.

Features:
- Automatic FSM state and transition arc extraction, including counters, from any RTL.
- Tight integration with `JasperGold` to verify reachability of each FSM state and arcs.
- SVA bind file generation (WIP).

Supported RTL style/codegen:
- All synthesizable SystemVerilog (thanks to slang).
- Handwritten RTL, and no need to conform to any EDA style guide.
- Popular hardware generator frameworks:
  - Chisel
  - nMigen
  - PyMTL
  - Genesis2
  - ...

Although the tool has been tested on a limited range of generator frameworks as well as hand-written RTL,
the algorithms make no assumption about how the RTL is structured. As a result, it should work with most hardware
generator frameworks out of the box. Please let us know if the algorithms fail to detect FSM in your framework.

## Usage
Generally the command line information can be obtained by invoking `detector -h`. Here are some example commands:

1. Print out FSM states and transition arcs for a single SV file `input.sv`
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv
   ```
2. Print out FSM states and transition arcs for multiple SV files
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input1.sv input2.sv
   ```
3. Specify top module as `TOP`
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv --top TOP
   ```
4. Specify reset/clock pin name. Notice that tool uses some naming convention for clock and reset name detection.
   If it fails to detect the corresponding pins, you have to specify manually:
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv --reset rst
   ```
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv --clock clk
5. Specify SystemVerilog include search directories, e.g. `dir1` and `dir2`:
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv -I dir1 dir2
   ```
6. Use `JasperGold` to verify the reachability for each state and arcs. Notice that you need to have `jaspergold`
  available in your shell. If a state or an arc is proven unreachable, the tool will indicate it in the printout.
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv --formal
   ```
7. Control `JasperGold` property proof options. Currently time limit, reset type, and double edge clock are supported.
   - reset type: `-R high` or `-R low`. If there is no reset or don't care, use `-R none`.
   - time limit per property: `-t 10`, which is set to 10 seconds.
   - double edge clock: `--double-edge-clock`
8. Use multi-threading. Set to `0` to use all available CPU cores. The example below shows how to use 4 CPU cores.
   Generally there is a close to linear speed up as we add more cores.
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv -n 4
   ```
9. Check coupled FSM. This will print out any coupled FSM in the design. Can be used with `JasperGold` for
cross-validation.
   ```bash
   $ ./detector -i input.sv -c
   ```

## How to download/build
Currently only Linux with AVX is supported. To see if your CPU supports AVX, simply do `cat /prof/cpuinfo | grep avx`.
### Use pre-built binaries
Here is a one-line install script
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuree/pastafarian/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```
The script will download the `detector` binary and `slang` driver into the current directory, `sudo` not required.
All the binaries are statically linked so they should work with most Linux systems.
### Build from source
This project requires C++17 compiler such as `g++-8` and `cmake`. Here is an example to build a release binary. Notice
that we need to update all the git submodules before we build everything.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kuree/pastafarian
cd pastafarian
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j
```
After the build, the `detector` file will be in the `bin/` folder. Use `make test` to check your build.

Notice that you also need to download the `slang` binary from [here](https://github.com/Kuree/binaries/raw/master/slang)
and make it executable. Then do `export SLANG=[path to slang]` in your shell so the `detector` can pick up the slang
driver at runtime.

## How it works
You can find a Latex-based documentation in `docs/` folder. To view the PDF, simply do `make` in the `docs` folder.
This requires to have `pdflatex` and `dot2tex` installed.

## Why called Pastafarian
Pastafarian is a parody religion called [Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).
Its acronym, FSM, is the same as Finite State Machine (FSM).
